## Gitbook

## Summary

Smart Contract for creating and automating IDO investment pools.

Smart Contract for staking, leveraging UniswapV2Pairs for specialized reward distribution based on derived token share from LP.

Pools have a start and end timestamps, along with minimum and maximum contribution amounts. Investors can contribute to IDO pools to receive future tokens based on a rate set in USDT, USDC, or alternatives. Funds collected are forwarded to a wallet as they arrive. More info on the intended functionality for pools and staking can be found in the gitbook documentation.
